Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Keep on keepin' on
The present waits for no one
Gett'er done
Life is like an oyster
When life gives you baloney, make lemonade
We are born with legs, but we were made to ride
Sleep is the most important meal of the day
When friends bring you down, carry the team to victory
God loves to party. That's it, nothing more to it
Water tastes how it sounds. Dumb
When faced with butter, microwave a knife
I think you have a stutter, here, have a grape
Candy corn reassembles neither candy nor corn, just yellow
From someone who has never seen a candle: "Even I know that hot stuff makes wax go blublublub. Icarus was simply small brain"
